<big><big>IDYLLS</big></big><br /><br />
By LAURA JEAN DOUGLAS.</p>

<p><b>MODERATOR</b> says:&mdash;“Some of the most exquisite prose we have read for many
a day.”</p>

<p class="c">
<img src="images/leaf.png" width="24" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p><b>IRISH NEWS</b> (Belfast) says:&mdash;“In the ten ‘Idylls’ which Miss Douglas
contributes, we have a group of the sweetest prose poetry possible.... A
gallery of lovely pictures.... A thing of beauty and a joy for ever....
The turn-out of the book is equal to anything of the same kind produced
in London.”</p>

<p class="c">
<img src="images/leaf.png" width="24" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p><b>MRS. ALICE A. PITMAN</b>, author of “<b>TALES FROM LONDON LIFE</b>,” says:&mdash;“The
pictures are beautifully conceived, and elegantly portrayed.”</p>

<p class="c">
<img src="images/leaf.png" width="24" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p><b>IRISH FIGARO</b> says:&mdash;“I am grateful to all who essay in a sincere spirit
the difficult task of making Dublin a book-producing place. In ‘The
Little Library,’ author, editor, publisher, and draughtsman have
combined in an honest endeavour to attain that desirable end. The writer
of ‘Idylls’ gives us ten short prose-poems, of which I take the liberty
to give the first in its entirety as a specimen. It is entitled, ‘A Rose
Garden.’... This is a beautiful picture.”</p>

<p class="c">

<p><b>JAMES H. COUSINS</b> says:&mdash;“Beautiful prose fancies.”</p>

<p><b>IRISH DAILY INDEPENDENT</b> says:&mdash;“The book is beautifully produced, and a
credit to Dublin.”</p>

</p>

<p><b>SCOTTISH SOCIETY</b> says:&mdash;“The weirdly-covered little book with the
strange frontispiece which comes to us under the title of ‘Idylls,’ will
be read with great enjoyment by all whose sense of literary quality is
sufficiently educated to appreciate the extreme delicacy of
word-painting in water-colours, if it may be so expressed.... In every
sense of the word, they are perfect representations of the idyll in its
purest form,... impossible to criticise, and difficult properly to
praise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span>”</p>

<h2><i>EDITOR’S NOTE.</i></h2>

<p class="c">
<img src="images/i_009.png" width="23" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>Wordsworth, writing a sonnet, having for its subject the sonnet-form,
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">“To me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sundry moods, ’twas pastime to be bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the sonnet’s scanty plot of ground;”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">and all those who have essayed the task of composing in this particular
form will admit that Wordsworth’s definition&mdash;“scanty plot of
ground”&mdash;characterises the sonnet’s limitations precisely.</p>

<p>As will be observed in the following pages, Mr. Cousins not only excels
as a sonneteer; but in “The Legend of the Blemished King” he performs
the remarkable feat of producing a poem of classical character,
containing forty-eight stanzas, cast perfectly in the no less difficult
mould known as the Spenserian stanza&mdash;eight heroic lines, followed by an
Alexandrine, rhyming thus:&mdash;1, 3; 2, 4, 5, 7; 6, 8, 9.</p>

<p>The subject, however more than the technique, is remarkable. It will
have an especial attraction for all who are interested in the ancient
literature of Ireland; and, indeed it should be of universal interest,
because of the fact that this story of Fergus bears a strong resemblance
to the Scriptural narrative of Eden and the Fall of Man. It is a kind of
allegory common to all ancient races, containing in its heart an
unobtruded moral, wrapped in dramatic incident and decorated with
charming pictures of land and sea.</p>

<p>It is, in short, what Fiona M’Leod would call a “legendary morality.”</p>

<p>The other poems are equally admirable; and, indeed, however considered,
I think that this book should prove a valuable addition to the best
literary products of Ireland.</p>

<img src="images/legend2.png"

alt="The Legend of the Blemished King."
/></h2>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note</span>:&mdash;I am indebted to “The Ecclesiastical History of Down and
Connor,” by Rev. James O’Laverty, for the story of the “Blemished King.”
Believing it to be comparatively unknown, and desiring, as far as lay in
my power, to spread a knowledge of the interesting stories and legends
which abound in Irish History and Literature, I translated it into
verse. I learn, however, that a poem on the same subject has been
written by the late Sir Samuel Ferguson, under the title of “Fergus
Wry-mouth.” I can only plead justification for running the inevitable
gauntlet of comparison between a giant and a pigmy, on the ground that I
had already committed myself to the publication of the present version
of the legend before I became aware of the fact mentioned. I have not
read the poem by Sir Samuel Ferguson, and I shall not do so until after
this volume is in print; but I have written Lady Ferguson on the matter,
and she very kindly refuses to see any possible objection to the
publication of my rendering of the story, seeing that it contains almost
as many stanzas as there are lines in Sir Samuel’s.</p>

<p>The Loch of Rory (<img src="images/gaelic22.png"
style="vertical-align:middle;"
width="85"
alt="Word in Gaelic"
/>), the centre around which the
following story moves, is Dundrum Bay. That bay is still remarkable for
its roar, which has been frequently referred to by ancient writers. Even
a modern poet (S. K. Cowan, in “Sung by Six”) has written of the bay,
“where deep seas moan.” Other evidences point to the identity of Rory
and Dundrum, in opposition to the conjectures of some that the present
Belfast Lough was the scene of the incidents contained in the “Legend of
the Blemished King.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Author.</span>]</p>

alt="The Legend of Saint Mahee of Endrim."

<p class="c">To J. A. Gregg.<br />&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Saint Mahee
(<img src="images/gaelic51a.png"
style="vertical-align:middle;"
width="65"
alt="Word in Gaelic"
/>) was born about 420 <small>A.D.</small>,
founded the Abbey of Endrim (<img src="images/gaelic51b.png"
style="vertical-align:middle;"
width="78"
alt="Word in Gaelic"
/>&mdash;the single ridge),
on the beautiful island bearing that name, about 450, and died in the
year 496 or 497. For several centuries the Abbey, in which education and
religion were combined, occupied a prominent position, and turned out a
number of subsequent founders of similar institutions. Between 974 and
1178 history is silent in regard to it, but it is certain that, from its
position on Cuan (<img src="images/gaelic51c.png"
style="vertical-align:middle;"
width="45"
alt="Word in Gaelic"
/>&mdash;a lough, now Strangford),
which was infested by Danish marauders, it came in for a large share of
their devastating attentions. From the date of its affiliation with an
English educational establishment, 1178, it seems to have fallen on evil
days, and in 1450 it is simply noted as a Parish Church in the charge of
the Bishop of Down.</p>

<hr style="width:10%;" />

<p>The Island of Endrim&mdash;or, as it is now called, in memory of its Patron
Saint, Mahee&mdash;is situated most picturesquely on Strangford Lough, about
seven miles from Comber, Co. Down, and is approachable on foot or car by
a modern causeway-road, which crosses an intervening island. On the
shoreward end of the island may be seen many remnants of the stone
buildings which superseded the original wooden structures. These
remnants include the stump of a round tower; traces of extensive
foundations once laid bare by the late Bishop Reeves, but now almost
entirely hidden from view; the site of the harbour where anchored “ships
from Britain;” evidences of a hallowed God’s-acre, and a fairly complete
castle of a later period. The circuit of the island can be made on foot
leisurely in a couple of hours, and the walk affords a view of the
extensive waters of the once Dane-infested lough, the distant hoary
walls of Greyabbey, the haunts of Saint Patrick, the reputed scene of
the death<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52">{52}</a></span>
of Ollav Fola
(<img src="images/gaelic52a.png"
style="vertical-align:middle;"
width="105"
alt="Word in Gaelic"
/>, the lawgiver of Erin),
and the martial deeds of De Courcey.</p>

<p>Ballydrain, about half-way between Comber and Mahee Island, is so-called
from
<img src="images/gaelic52b.png"
style="vertical-align:middle;"
width="50"
alt="Word in Gaelic"
/>, a townland, and
<img src="images/gaelic52c.png"
style="vertical-align:middle;"
width="75"
alt="Word in Gaelic"
/>, a
blackthorn tree; and the reader will observe the connection between this
place and the Island of Mahee. No trace of a church has yet been
discovered at Ballydrain.</p>

<p>The idea contained in the Legend has been variously rendered by several
eminent authors. The incident in which it is here embodied may, however,
be fairly claimed as the oldest version&mdash;the original, in fact.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The

<span class="i0">Royster around thy high phantasmal tiers!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How mean our mockings of the silent seers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To read the riddle of th’ Eternal Soul!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We list’ the thundering life within thy bole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And count the hidden harvest that anears,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And dream our dreams, and smile to see them wrecked!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, vain insurgence on the unrevealed:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Enough to map the paths our fathers tracked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not, mother-like, kiss yet the face concealed.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Age ages not the elemental law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we are thou in hope, thou we anew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still beneath are depths whence Shakspere drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And still above are stars that Milton saw!<br /></span>
